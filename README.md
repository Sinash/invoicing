Make sure node.js is installed in your system using the below command. Else install it from https://nodejs.org/

    node -v

Install dependencies listed in package.json with:

    npm install

Retrieve frontend dependencies with Bower, compile SASS, and move frontend files into place:

    gulp

Now that you have the environment configured, you need to create a database configuration for it. For create database tables use this command:

    php artisan migrate

And to initial populate database use this:

    php artisan db:seed

If you have configured the appication in your localhost using virtual host under the port say for example 9999, you can access the application at
